# myorganbook
Organ Accompaniment for Catholic Hymns

An Organ Book is something of an ongoing pipedream, but here I collect together my attempts in case I can scrape together something useful.

Another related repository of mine is [Nova Organi Harmonia](https://github.com/veromary/nova-organi-harmonia) forked from a more serious repo. I really love the Nova Organi Harmonia, but my work will probably be geared more to convenience.

God bless,

Veronica
